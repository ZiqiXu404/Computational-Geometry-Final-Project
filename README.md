# Computational Geometry Final Project - Sweepline Algorithm
*Stephanie Xu*

*CS163 Computational Geometry, Fall 2022*

*Professor Diane Souvaine*

## Overview
Using the vertile line sweep algorithm we learned this semester, the program computes and visualizes the skyline of a
set of rectangular buildings that are projected onto a plane. The skyline is the upper contour of the 
rectangular buildings that are built on the same flat ground.

The program could randomly generate a given number of buildings and visualizes the buildlings and the skyline.

## To use

* ##### External dependencies
    ```pip install matplotlib```
    
    ```pip install numpy```
* Run the program

    ```python sweepline.py```
